## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project was to provide an easy way for people to budget. We often notice in our lives that we can overspend in one area. Using our tools, individuals grasp a better understanding of what they can use the money for.

## What it does

After users input their costs, BudgetBud returns back a recommended amount for individuals to save and how much they should spend each month.

## How we built it

BudgetBud was built on React.JS. The distinct parts are divided into components allowing the team to work on each component. It also allowed for better organization.

## Challenges we ran into

We were unfamiliar with how to use git and spent a fair amount of time on dealing with pull/push issues. Additionally, we faced complications on how to actually update the elements on the page after getting user information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting the information from the user to the different sections.

## What we learned

We learned how to use git, states in JavaScript, and how to work together as a team on a coding project.

## What's next for BudgetBud

For BudgetBud, next, we would like to setup more flexible types of earning. For example, do you want to save 50% and spend 50% or save 20% and spend 80%? We also want to add predetermined profiles; such as "student" and BudgetBud will use data on how students should spend their money and the extra costs associated with them (textbooks, etc.). Finally, we would also like to add an account feature where users can return back and see their budget over time. It also allows them to keep track of their budgets. With the account feature, we'd like to see a PDF export so that users can also have a local copy to refer to the budget.
